/* 
The CSS code you provided sets styles for all elements in the HTML document using the universal selector `*`. Let's break down each property:

1. `margin: 0;`
   This sets the margin of all elements to 0. Margins are the space around an element, and setting them to 0 removes any default margin that may be applied by the browser.

2. `padding: 0;`
   This sets the padding of all elements to 0. Padding is the space inside an element, and setting it to 0 ensures that there is no extra space inside the elements.

3. `box-sizing: border-box;`
   The `box-sizing` property determines how the total width and height of an element is calculated. By setting it to `border-box`, the width and height of an element includes the content, padding, and border. This ensures that the specified width and height properties of an element are applied as intended.

4. `font-family: "Roboto";`
   This sets the font family of all elements to "Roboto". The font-family property specifies the preferred font for text inside an element. In this case, "Roboto" is a popular font choice that will be applied to all elements.

By applying these styles to all elements using the universal selector `*`, you are essentially resetting the default styles and creating a consistent starting point for your CSS styles within your HTML document.
